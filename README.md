# p7_maze_game
A maze game created with a 2D JS engine

Making use of an algorithm the maze is randomly built in each refresh, making sure there is a way out in every construction.
The controllers of the ball are the arrows. And even with the little bugs I found in the 2D JS engine, the app works well.
At the end, when you finish, the maze is destroyed, and a little phrase will appear on the screen.
